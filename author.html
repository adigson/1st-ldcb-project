<h1>My lineage</h1>
<ul><li>From Ko'ole: A Traditional Paedeatrics from Ile-Ife
<p>He was <em>my great grand father</em>. He journeyed to Abeokuta
where he was welcomed and made to feel at home due to his feats and thus
established himself at Ita-Elega in Abeokuta.</p></li>
<li>Bello Bolaji: My Grand Father
<p>This was the first to accept Islaam in my lineage from Ko'ole.This he did
while at Abeokuta and remained therein till death.</p></li>
<li>Muhammad Murtado Bolaji (Apola): My Father
<p>Late Apola breath his last in the year 1994 at his residence in Ibadan, Oyo
State. He was survived with two house-wives (one of whom is my mum), children
and grand-children. In fact, I am the 14th of his children.</p></li>
<li>Muhammad Misbaahud-Deen: Myself!
<p>I was born on the <strong>20th of March, 1980</strong> in the city of Ibadan at a Catholic
Hospital. Left for Lagos in 1984 wherein I did my primary and secondary schoolings.
I graduated from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State in 2007 with a
2.2 B.Sc Honors in International Relations. Though I married while in Ile-Ife during
my 300 level years, I am residing in Warri Delta State at the moment. This was where I carried
out my national service. Equally, my secondary place of assignment during my NYSC was at a Madrasah with
which the desire to stay back after service was gathered. Al-hamduliLlaah this has continued to provide
notable opportunities at propogating <em>the Deen of Allaah!</em></p></li></ul>
